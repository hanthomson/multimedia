				<h4 class="outfits"> summer style:</h4>
				<p>This outfit is one of my faves to wear abroad width the light material keeping you breezy in the heat. Animal prints are so in atm and snakeskin is my go-to. This number is from one of my most favourite sites: Missguided! The dress is £28 but the company usually have discounts daily. It's true to size and has elasticated sleeves and waistband. I paired this patterned dress with my beloved Gucci bag which is obviously super expensive but it goes with just about anything. At around £800, it's deffo not student-loan friendly even though it's classic. To finish off my outfit I wore my Fila Disruptor trainers. These chunky white shoes literally make you super tall and give your outfit a cool edge. The fact they're white allows them to go with everything, and they're super comfy. I picked mine up from JD sports for £80. Again, not cheap but I wear them none-stop so I feel like they're worth the money. Overall, this outfit is summery, girly yet has an urban edge. Perfect for city breaks and day-drinking. You can click on the photos for direct links to all the items, most of them should have student discount options too!</p>

				<h4 class="outfits"> hangover chill: </h4>
				<p>Some days your style reflects your mood and this outfit was deffo one of them! Hungover Han is a nightmare and I couldn't be arsed to then start paring leather trousers with a bralet and blazer. It's all about comfort for when I'm feeling that ill. However, comfort doesn't mean you still can't look good. Today's outfit consists of Missguided white joggers, which I wore with cycling shorts underneath for maximum security. Priced at £15, they're a bargain and a basic staple for every wardrobe. On top I wore a pink and white striped baggy t-shirt dress tucked in, again from Missguided. Although I couldn't find the link for the exact one, I have added a similar item. Completing the Missguided outfit, is an £38 oversized denim jacket, a wardrobe must-have. I love wearing this with any outfit, it's a classic. Not only is it light-weight so you can wear it easily on sunny days, it's made from such good quality material and I deffo see it as a piece that will last for ages. On my nails I have some natural styled glue on acrylics from Kiss. At around £7, they are on the pricier side yet they last for ages, especially on a drunken night out! Paired with this is a snakeskin shrunchie, my fave animal print atm. I think I purchased this from Topshop but will leave the link on the photos as per usual. Happy hangover everyone. Remember your paracetamol and water and get comfy!</p>

				<h4 class="outfits"> block colour: </h4>
				<p>Another day, another t-shirt dress but this one I loveeeeee! I have never been a fan of navy but this dress has just changed my mind. Contrasted with mustard yellow, it gives of fashionable rugby shirt vibes. Comfy, casual yet super stylish. The colours scream spring, and the cuffed sleeves just add to the cuteness. It's quite thick material so is good whilst spring is still warming up. You can find the dress on my favourite website, Missguided (Of course!) for £25. Since the length is quite short I wore cycling shorts underneath which I got from Boohoo for £5. Another basic I reccommed to everyone, especially in black as you can wear them with pretty much anything. To give the dress more shape, I wore a white Missguided seat-belt style belt, that came with another dress. With this being the latest trend, and a dupe for the desinger brand off-white, the block print adds an edgy vibe to this look, and can be worn with many dresses due to its monochrome colour scheme. Adding more white into the look, I wore my Nike trainers, another wardrobe classic. They pretty much go with everything and are super comfy to wear. You can pick these up from JD sports for £75. Another big investment but an item I would recommend if you want shoes that are versatile. Finally, my baby Gucci bag, already mentioned on this page but so beautiful and my favourite go-to bag. Check out the links through my photos!</p>
