				<p class="text1">Welcome to a brand-new series on my blog called Student Spots, where I take you around all the student-y most instagrammable places I can find and review them for you all, so you’re not wasting a single drop of that loan. First up, 96 Degrees in Leicester, situated just off DMU campus and known for its cosy, minimalistic vibes. With metal furnishings contrasted against oak, hanging bulb lights and the accents of greenery, it’s aesthetic heaven. With this cosy coffee shop proudly serving healthy, wholesome food, I knew I wanted to try out an afternoon smoothie to see if my energy levels increase. Although the shop is open until 4pm, their main focus is breakfast, serving all kinds of yum from eggs benedict to porridge. However, this means for me, on my 3pm visit, the choices were slim. The vegetarian sandwich options weren’t my cup of tea and the ‘make your own smoothie’ bowl had all of a couple bananas, a handful of mixed berries and one lonely little apple left within it. Once my banana and berry smoothie came, it was filled right to the brim and was so vibrant. My boyfriend got himself a hot chocolate and we drank away. The smoothie was so sweet and refreshing and was served with a paper straw, helping the environment, another bonus! However, at roughly £4 the drink wasn’t the cheapest, especially when it could be made so easily at home....

				<p class="text1">At the end of the day, no matter how much you plan out your weeks and how much ‘me’ time you give yourself, university is still a massive hurdle. With the pressure of University being the ‘best three years of your life’, some of you must be wondering why this isn’t applying to you. If TV shows and films portray university as the place to find yourself, is there just something wrong with you? I think in reality; a lot of students feel a little lost. With university being a very social place where you decided how involved you get, it can be very easy to seclude yourself if you’re shy, never mind if you’re suffering with mental health. Making friends feels like you’ve been asked to bungee jump and group work feels like a sky dive; scary. In a dream world everyone would be educated on mental health. Unfortunately, the reality is very different. As I mentioned in my first blog post, I have openly talked about my struggles online. I not only expose myself to (hopefully) help others, but as a way to help my friends and family understand what’s going on inside my head. I’ve already hinted that maybe universities would benefit from more student to student services, online chat rooms or discussion boards, even face to face group sessions as It is so important to open up about how you are feeling. In saying this, discussing your mental health can just be as equally daunting as the idea of making any friends at all....

				<p class="text1">I wouldn’t be able to share my experiences about Leicester without telling you all about O’Neill’s. My favourite bar in the whole city and for plenty of reasons too. Firstly, the décor is super cosy yet modern with loads of little nooks and crannies for you and your friends to gossip in. The blue contrasted with wood makes you feel just at home. The bar wraps all away around the pub, allowing you to be served from all areas. The staff are always polite and friendly and are very good at ensuring customer safety, with ID checks and turning away disorderly members of the public. Although it is a chain, the food is decent. You have a wide selection of pub grub and they have recently introduced a ‘Vegetarian and Vegan’ menu, perfect if you’re anything like me! My personal favourite is the drunken mushrooms and the brand-new breaded BBQ cauliflower with ranch sauce. Drinks wise, they have an extensive menu ranging from hot and soft drinks to all sorts of spirits, liquors and wines. With a massive projector and TV’s everywhere you look, the location is perfect for watching sports. I regularly go there to watch Liverpool FC play but have also noticed they show plenty of other sports, such as boxing and rugby. And if you’re too engaged into the game to want to go and order at the bar, don’t worry, they also have an App where you can order anything from the menu straight to your table! However....

				<p class="text1">We’ve discussed a lot about mental health and university, tips tricks and advice to make your work load seem manageable and opening yourself up to others. But, what about outside of university. We can’t control our illnesses, but we could work on the environment we live in. Whether you live at home or in student accommodation, mental health doesn’t just stop once your classes have finished and your coursework has been handed in. There’s a clear connection between your living factors and mental health. We all know that planning and being organised can slow down the rising stress levels and music, books and podcasts can act as a presence to help you through your work. But what about switching off? Can you be alone with your mind, with nothing to do? Can you relax? There are many studies that show the positive impacts of a healthy lifestyle, whether this is diet, exercise or connecting with your surroundings. As I, obviously, study in Leicester, I wanted to create my own map to show you the places and areas I go to clean my brain and have a break from life: Having quiet time is crucial to let your brain rest. Even to me, the thought of lying on my couch and daydreaming terrifies me. I have certainly learnt that being alone with my mind is 100% the opposite of peaceful. So, what can we do to have quiet time without actually being silent? This being said and as I wrote in my Foundations of Change blog....

				<p class="text1">Welcome to the first blog of my new series Travel Adventures! Travel is one of my main passions and I absolutely love going away to different places every year especially when there is so much to see of the world. In February this year me and my boyfriend Nathan headed to Amsterdam over our university half term, even though we should’ve really been doing some work! Amsterdam is somewhere I always wanted to go, it has just never materialised. When Nathan told me he’d booked for us to go I couldn’t believe it. Even though it was only for two nights, we got so much done. Plus, it meant we could get back and get to work. We flew from East Midlands Airport which was a nightmare, who knew the train to EAST MIDLANDS PARKWAY doesn’t have any public transport to EAST MIDLANDS airport??? Anyway, once we got there I figured out two of my favourite YouTubers Sophia and Cinzia were also on my flight to Amsterdam, CRAZYYYYY. Meeting them definitely made up for the wacky transport system. We stayed on the outskirts of Amsterdam in a place called The Student Hotel as it was so much cheaper and student friendly than staying in the centre plus with a metro stop opposite the hotel, access to the city was a breeze. On the first night we made our way around a few bars and pubs until my tiredness caught up with me and we had to call it a day. Throughout our full day there we explored all the canals and took some pictures of the beautiful houses. The sex museum was a bit of a let-down....

				<p class="text1">Hola! Today’s blog is about my trip away to Madrid in Spain. As some of you may know I got accepted onto the Erasmus Study Exchange programme to study a year abroad at San Pablo University in Madrid. How exciting! As soon as I got the news I knew I wanted to visit the city as many times I could before moving in September. So, very irresponsibly I booked a trip the weekend before my deadlines, whoops! However, I had the best time. A well-deserved break and a chance to get used to be soon-to-be surroundings. Me and Nathan flew from Stanstead and were super impressed with the airport… it had a Wetherspoons! Perfect for us northerners. We had some drinks and boarded the plane and the flight went surprisingly quickly. Once we arrived we jumped on the metro and headed to our hotel. The room was so nice and the hotel was beautiful. On top of this the pillows were SO comfy. We wanted to go out the first night but I felt exhausted from the long day and trip. We ended up just getting a maccies and went to sleep. The next day we spent the morning looking around my future university and all the quaint little streets. Madrid is so beautiful and there was so many doggies, which always makes my day 100 times better. Then we headed to the pub to watch the football where we ended up getting very, very, very drunk, whoops! This drinking turned into a night of clubbing....
